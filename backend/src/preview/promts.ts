export const PROMPT_USER = `Create a description of a stylized toy doll inspired by the visual elements in the image, focusing only on the appearance of the clothing, hair, and accessories for the purpose of designing a collectible figurine. Include details such as hair color and style, clothing style and color, shoes, and any visible accessories (e.g., necklace, bag). Do not mention or describe any person, facial shape, facial expression, emotions, nationality, social status, or identity. The doll must have a cute appearance with large eyes and a friendly smile, typical of collectible figurines, and must be exactly 15 cm tall with consistent proportions: head is 30% of the total height (4.5 cm), torso is 40% (6 cm), legs are 30% (4.5 cm), arms are 5 cm long and extend to the middle of the torso. The doll's width at the shoulders must be 5 cm. If there are background elements in the image that could inspire accessories for the doll (e.g., objects nearby), describe them as potential miniature additions for the doll's packaging, but limit the number of accessories to a maximum of 3. The accessories must be simple in design with no intricate details (e.g., a plain book, a basic necklace, a simple cup—avoid textures, patterns, or tiny elements), suitable for 3D printing on a low-detail printer, and each accessory must be exactly 2 cm by 2 cm in size. Do not attempt to identify any person or provide any personal information.`;
