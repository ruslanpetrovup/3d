export const PROMPT_PHOTO = `A cute, stylized toy doll in a fully transparent plastic blister packaging, similar to a collectible figurine box. [DESCRIPTION] The doll stands in the center of the packaging. Surrounding the doll are up to three simple accessories in separate compartments, inspired by the description: [ACCESSORIES]. The doll must be exactly 600 pixels tall (representing 15 cm at scale) with consistent proportions: head is 30% of the height (180 pixels), torso is 40% (240 pixels), legs are 30% (180 pixels), arms are 200 pixels long and extend to the middle of the torso, and the doll's width at the shoulders is 200 pixels. Each accessory must be exactly 80 pixels by 80 pixels (representing 2 cm by 2 cm at scale). The packaging must be absolutely identical for all dolls with no variations allowed: the entire package is 1024 pixels tall and 768 pixels wide (representing 65 cm tall and 59 cm wide at scale), with a fully transparent background showing only the plastic blister and the doll and accessories inside. The transparent blister has exactly three square compartments on the right side for accessories, each compartment precisely 80 pixels by 80 pixels, arranged vertically with 50 pixels spacing between them, starting 200 pixels from the top edge of the package and 608 pixels from the left edge. The doll is centered in the main compartment, which is 300 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall, located 234 pixels from the left edge and 200 pixels from the top edge. Additionally, include two smaller versions of the doll (each 200 pixels tall) on the left and right sides of the main doll, positioned 50 pixels from the left edge and 468 pixels from the left edge, respectively, both 200 pixels from the top edge. Include a small accessory (e.g., a tiny bag, 80 pixels by 80 pixels) on the left side, 50 pixels from the left edge and 300 pixels from the top edge. The overall style is clean, vibrant, and playful, with a slightly glossy finish on the packaging. Ensure the doll and accessories are clearly visible with sharp outlines and minimal shadows, making them easy to extract for 3D modeling purposes, with no variations in size, proportions, or packaging design allowed.`;

export const PROMPT_USER = `Create a description of a stylized toy doll inspired by the visual elements in the image, focusing only on the appearance of the clothing, hair, and accessories for the purpose of designing a collectible figurine. Include details such as hair color and style, clothing style and color, shoes, and any visible accessories (e.g., necklace, bag).

The doll's width at the shoulders must be 5 cm. If there are background elements in the image that could inspire accessories for the doll (e.g., objects nearby), describe them as potential miniature additions for the doll's packaging, but limit the number of accessories to a maximum of 3. The accessories must be simple in design with no intricate details (e.g., a plain book, a basic necklace, a simple cupâ€”avoid textures, patterns, or tiny elements), suitable for 3D printing on a low-detail printer, and each accessory must be exactly 2 cm by 2 cm in size. Do not attempt to identify any person or provide any personal information.`;
